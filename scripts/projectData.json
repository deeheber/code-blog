This taught me how to better utilize JavaScript Objects to store data within an application and to build out things with scalability in mind.</p><p>My favorite feature of this is the interactivity where the user can select a specific shop to show as well as update the data within the tables.</p><p>Some enhancement ideas include but aren't limited to: adding an input field where the user can add a new shop table to the app as well as adding persistence to store the changes made to the numbers that the user has entered.</p><p><img src=\"http://techonomy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/shutterstock_42765808-610x354.jpg\" /></p>",

Well you're in luck, because this site can help suggest fun activities in the area.</p><p>This was one of my first collaboration projects using git. My team was looking to solve the problem of not being able to decide what to do when you have visitors from out of town.</p><p>Due to time constraints, we decided it was best to use radio buttons for the activity picker, however we're looking to rewrite the logic to allow for checkboxes instead. This way, you wouldn't have to rely on the 'reset' button to clear out the current selections.</p><p>This app also keeps the currently selected radio boxes in the browser's local storage, just in case the site visitor navigates away from the page to view an external resource and wants to come back to the activities page just as they left it. My main contribution to this was writing the underlying  JS logic for the radio buttons on the 'activities' page.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.travelportland.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/portland-streetcar-downtown.jpg\" /></p>",

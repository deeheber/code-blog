This project gave me some practice in better utilizing JavaScript Objects to store data.</p><p>My favorite feature is the interactivity where the user can select a specific shop to show as well as update the data within the tables.</p><p><img src=\"/images/donutshop.png\" /></p>",

We decided to combine our efforts and talents to build out a solution on our own.</p><p>This app was built with a mobile first apprach with the angle that cyclists in Portland, OR would be using this while on the go. The heart of the application is the map in which we customized using the Google Maps JavaScript API. Some features of the map include a heatmap that shows simulated crime data, bicycle parking locations, and a location finder. We also had the vision of creating a small peer to peer community and added a discussion board using Disqus.</p><p>My primary contributions indcluded adding the user interactivity to hide/show the different data layers for the map and also adding in the functions to build those custom data layers.</p><p>Some enhancements we'd like to add in the 2.0 version include obtaining data sources from the Portland Police in order to dynamically populate that data. One of the biggest challenges while building this was being able to get access to accurate data with enough data points to build out a heatmap, so the current version is simulated data based off of data points from <a href=\"http://www.civicapps.org\" target=\"_blank\">civicapps.org</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/images/bikebright.png\"/></p>",
